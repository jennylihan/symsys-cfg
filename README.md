# Context Free Grammar Gallery

This is a website that takes context-free grammars that students have built using this [Nearley Parser Playground](https://omrelli.ug/nearley-playground/) and uses the nearley npm package to generate sentences from each grammar.

I created as a gallery of student work for [this assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ld3np4gpDrVmVDXXdS4xg0Z5-_5ICO3Rig-dVE5M-z4/edit?usp=sharing) that I also wrote for symsys1!
